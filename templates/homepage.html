                    Context Funds held for various activities across the University are separated into individual project grants (PG s). There are currently approx. 30,000+ active PG s. The underlying funds in each of these PG s are invested in accordance to the profile
                    and duration of the funds across four investment pools (Long Term Pool (LTP), Medium Term Pool (MTP), Short Term Pool (STP) and Cash Pool (CP). The funds earn a return each year based on the average monthly balance in the PG s. Problem
                    For budgeting and planning purposes, the beneficiaries of the funds in the PG s require estimates of the return on their funds and estimated balances at points in time, this may extend through multiple financial periods. These estimate
                    requests are currently calculated manually which is very time consuming given the number of them. Goal The project team is asked to build a solution that automates this process. The solution should: Allow users to input different parameters
                    i.e. date funds received, spending profile of funds, investment pool funds are held in, recapitalisation assumptions Allow the treasury team to input and maintain investment pool forecast return assumptions as well as actual returns
                    at year-end. Allow modelling/scenario analysis for new funds i.e. modelling and comparing returns in the different pools. Benefit Automating this process will allow these estimates to be generated on demand by the users and ensure
                    that they calculated in a consistent manner across the University. This tool would allow for more pro-active planning as the users the ability to any parameters and assess the impact of those changes in real time.
